Somewhere between then and now you discovered this cairne in the fog. I hope it is useful in some way. Inspiration, reference, or whatever you're looking for.

This is written perhaps as more of a reminder for myself than it is for you, but then again you could be future me or maybe past me stuck in a strange loop...

```bash
$ whoami
error: entity unknown or undefined
```

Steady...

The way out, is through.

## Feature Highlights

- Flake-based multi-host, multi-user NixOS and Home-Manager configurations
  - Core configs for hosts and users
  - Modular, optional configs for user and host-specific needs
- Secrets management via sops-nix and a private nix-secrets repo which is included as a flake input
- Automated remote-bootstrapping of NixOS, nix-config, and nix-secrets
- Multiple YubiKey device handling and agent forwarding
- Basic NixOs and Home-Manager build automation recipes

The roadmap of additional features is laid across functionally thematic stages that can be viewed, along with short term objectives, in the [Roadmap of TODOs](docs/TODO.md).

Completed features will be added here as each stage is complete.

## Requirements

- NixOS 23.11 or later to properly receive passphrase prompts when building in the private nix-secrets repo
- Patience
- Attention to detail
- Persistance
- More disk space

## Structure Quick Reference

For details about design concepts, constraints, and how structural elements interact, see the article and/or Youtube video [Anatomy of a NixOS Config](https://unmovedcentre.com/posts/anatomy-of-a-nixos-config/) available on my website.

For a large screenshot of the concept diagram, as well as previous iterations, see [Anatomy](docs/anatomy.md).

</div>

- `flake.nix` - Entrypoint for hosts and user home configurations. Also exposes a devshell for  manual bootstrapping tasks (`nix develop` or `nix-shell`).
- `hosts` - NixOS configurations accessible via `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>`.
  - `common` - Shared configurations consumed by the machine specific ones.
    - `core` - Configurations present across all hosts. This is a hard rule! If something isn't core, it is optional.
    - `disks` - Declarative disk partition and format specifications via disko.
    - `optional` - Optional configurations present across more than one host.
    - `users` - Host level user configurations present across at least one host.
  - `genoa` - stage 3
  - `ghost` - stage 4
  - `grief` - Lab - Qemu VM
  - `gooey` - stage 5
  - `guppy` - Remote Install Lab - Qemu VM
  - `gusto` - Theatre - Asus VivoPC - 1.5GHz Celeron 1007U, 4GB RAM, onboard Intel graphics
- `home/<user>` - Home-manager configurations, built automatically during host rebuilds.
  - `common` - shared home-manager configurations consumed the user's machine specific ones.
    - `core` - Home-manager configurations present for user across all machines. This is a hard rule! If something isn't core, it is optional.
    - `optional` - Optional home-manager configurations that can be added for specific machines. These can be added by category (e.g. options/media) or individually (e.g. options/media/vlc.nix) as needed.
      The home-manager core and options are defined in host-specific .nix files housed in `home/<user>`.
- `lib` - Custom library used throughout the nix-config to make import paths more readable.
- `modules` - Custom modules to enable special functionality for nixos or home-manager oriented configurations.
- `nixos-installer` - A stripped down version of the main nix-config flake used exclusively for generating ISOs and during installation of NixOS and nix-config on hosts.
- `overlays` - Custom modifications to upstream packages.
- `pkgs` - Custom packages meant to be shared or upstreamed.
- `vars` - Custom variables used throughout the nix-config. Most of the variables are focused on the primary user across all hosts.
- `scripts` - Custom scripts for automation, including remote installation and bootstrapping of NixOS and nix-config.

## Secrets Management

Secrets for this config are stored in a private repository called nix-secrets that is pulled in as a flake input and managed using the sops-nix tool.

For details on how this is accomplished, how to approach different scenarios, and troubleshooting for some common hurdles, please see my article and accompanying YouTube video [NixOS Secrets Management](https://unmovedcentre.com/technology/2024/03/22/secrets-management.html) available on my website.
